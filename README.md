# DesignPatterns
This repo contains different examples to demonstrate design patterns used in OOP.
In Object Oriented Programming languages such as Java, we often design classes, methods etc. And we create instances of those classes to call their behviour (methods) to get some functionalities done. At initial level while designing the classes, we generally don't give much thought. And later these becomes challenging to manage these classes. So, to overcome from such challenges, we should use a design patterns to acheive <b>Code readibility</b>
<b>Code maintaibility</b>
<b>Code extensibility</b>

The design patterns are basically classified into three broad categories:
<li>Creational Design Pattern</li>
<li>Structural Design Pattern</li>
<li>Behavioural Design Pattern</li>

<b>Creational Design Pattern</b>
This focuses on creation of objects. There are several such as Factory Design Pattern, Abstract Factory Design Pattern, Builder Design Pattern, Singleton Design Pattern, Decorator Design Pattern etc.
